### Challenge 4: Multi-Source Log Correlation (Advanced - 600 points)
**Description:** Correlate events across multiple log sources to identify complex attack patterns.

**Scenario:** Your organization has experienced a sophisticated attack and you need to analyze logs from multiple systems to understand the full scope.

**Tasks:**
1. Analyze logs from web servers, firewalls, and IDS/IPS systems
2. Correlate events across all log sources
3. Identify the attack vector and methodology
4. Determine the scope of the compromise
5. Create a comprehensive timeline
6. Identify any data exfiltration attempts
7. Document the complete attack chain

**Tools Needed:**
